### How to ask questions or report a problem here?
**If you want to get your question answered quickly, please stick to those three rules:**

### 1 - Write your Minecraft version in the title:
Example: 1.14.3: My chat is not being formatted per-world

### 2 - Be clear: What is your current situation, the desired situation, and your problem?
Example: I want my chat to be formatted in vanilla but not the creative world. My current situation is it is being formatted everywhere. I made sure not to use reload and haven't found any console errors. What I am doing wrong? **Please use pastebin.com to upload any errors**.

### 3 - Upload your plugin's folder.

Right-click the folder and follow the instructions below. For macOS right-click and select "Compress"
